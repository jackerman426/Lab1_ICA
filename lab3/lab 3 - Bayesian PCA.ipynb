      "### Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "In this lab assignment, we will implement a variational algorithm for Bayesian PCA. Unlike regular PCA based on maximization of retained variance or minimization of projection error (see Bishop, 12.1.1 and 12.1.2), probabilistic PCA defines a proper density model over observed and latent variables. We will work with a fully Bayesian model this time, which is to say that we will put priors on our parameters and will be interested in learning the posterior over those parameters. Bayesian methods are very elegant, but require a shift in mindset: we are no longer looking for a point estimate of the parameters (as in maximum likelihood or MAP), but for a full posterior distribution.\n",
      "\n",
      "The integrals involved in a Bayesian analysis are usually analytically intractable, so that we must resort to approximations. In this lab assignment, we will implement the variational method described in Bishop99. Chapters 10 and 12 of the PRML book contain additional material that may be useful when doing this exercise.\n",

At this point, you should be able to spot the expectations $\\langle\\cdot\\rangle_{k \\neq i}$ over the other $Q$-distributions that appear in Bishop's solution (eq. 13). Now, keeping all $Q_k, k \\neq i$ fixed, maximize the expression with respect to $Q_i$. You should be able to spot the form of the optimal $ln Q_i$, from which $Q_i$ can easily be obtained."
